# Gatling Sample Framework

In this template, we have three simualtion classes. For running a simualtion with single injection profile, we have IndividualAPI class. 
On the other hand, if we want a simulation with multiple injection profiles,  we have MultipleScenarios class for that. And lastly, we have Chaining class as well 
which showcases the chaining of multiple scenarios.


To run all the simulation together, we can simply do that by:-

1. move to the directory ../GatlingDEMO/DEMO and execute the following commnad.
 
 ```
 sbt gatling:test
 ```
